### Hi there 👋

🎓 I'm a Lawyer with 11 years of experience in the profession currently on a journey to become a programmer.

🌱 I'm learning Frontend Web development through freeCodeCamp and CoderHouse courses.

🔭 At the moment I'm working as a private attourney, and making my way into my first projects in the tech industry.

👟 Aside from my professional aspirations, I enjoy playing videogames and doing sports like swimming, snowboarding, hiking and running. I'm also an avid traveller having been to many countries over the years. 

🎭 My other interests are reading economy and political philosophy, and keeping myself informed about local and world news.
